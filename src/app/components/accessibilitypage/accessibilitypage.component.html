        </p>
        <p>
          Known limitations for the Services:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Radar page:</strong> The Weather Channel properties include a Radar page that includes a map of the area and map tiles of weather events. These images are not readable by screen readers because the map tiles are generated dynamically and convey information by showing a picture of an area and the potential weather conditions for that area. Please go to the Today, Hourly or 10 Day page for weather conditions and forecast information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Orientation:</strong> The Weather Channel mobile applications are not designed for landscape view. Certain user groups such as the motorically impaired users may want to use the screen in a specific orientation (portrait or landscape) for operational convenience, but the design only supports single 'portrait' mode.
          </li>
