          <li>We work with vendors for advertising purposes. These vendors use cookies and mobile advertising identifiers to direct and measure “personalized ads,” which are tailored to your likely interests based on your activities across some of the other apps and websites you use.</li>
          <li>We work with analytics vendors that use data collection technologies to track, analyze, and report data about the use of our websites or apps and to analyze and optimize the performance of the websites or apps.</li>
          <li>We work with technology vendors to support our apps and websites; for transparency, we list those vendors below.</li>

          This page lists opt-out options provided by our vendors as well as links for you to find information about their privacy practices. We may use these vendors for all our apps and websites, and we may use different vendors in specific regions.

        <p>
          The opt-outs described below may be device- or browser-specific and may not be available for all devices. The scope of the opt-out is determined by each vendor. For example, if you opt out on your mobile device, you may continue to receive personalized advertising on your desktop computer or other devices. If you choose to opt out, you will still see ads, but the ads will not be personalized ads.
